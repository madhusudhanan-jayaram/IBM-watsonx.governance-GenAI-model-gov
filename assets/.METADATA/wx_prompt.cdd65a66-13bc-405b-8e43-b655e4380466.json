Hailstones of varying sizes, ranging from small pellets to large golf balls, rained down on the vehicle with relentless force. The impact of the hailstones caused extensive damage to the exterior of the vehicle, leaving behind a multitude of dents and dings on the roof, hood, trunk, and all sides.

The appraiser meticulously inspected the vehicle, documenting each dent, ding, and broken window.

Their ultimate goal is to see their vehicle restored to its original beauty and performance, ready to hit the road once again, unaffected by the devastating hailstorm.Output:"}}},"location_definition":{"physical_location_code":"DAL","physical_location_code_assigned_by":"IBMid-501RWAYC7P","physical_location_code_rds_id":"c57cb90f-2126-3800-9c9f-9eab82021cdf","physical_location_code_rds_version":"00002023-0210-4141-8913-025823000000_3","physical_location_code_assignment_method":"INFERRED","physical_location_code_added_on":"1699642358863"},"modelfacts_system":{"model_information":{"model_type":"","model_description":"","input_type":"","algorithm":"","prediction_type":"","software_spec":"","software_spec_id":"","asset_type":"wx_prompt","label_column":""},"training_information":{"project_name":"Getting started with watsonx governance","training_data_references":[],"hyper_parameters":"","hybrid_pipeline":[],"features":0},"project_details":{"id":"7c8a045c-17e6-48b4-9438-a3af9fb2b124","environment_type":"development","is_environmenttype_openscale_value":false},"model_identity_information":{"model_identity_key":"4433bd3a4eb9963aa330b844551b4de01f08b4cc3600a9226852caf02e506544"},"deployment_details":[],"modelentry_information":{}},"modelfacts_user":{}},"attachments":[{"id":"7e1c3cc2-b22f-44e8-882a-ad02728ad247","version":2,"asset_type":"wx_prompt","name":"Insuranceclaimkeyinformationextraction.json","mime":"application/json","datasource_type":"193a97c1-4475-4a19-b90c-295c4fdc6517","object_key":"wx_prompt/Insuranceclaimkeyinformationextraction__da__t28nebiwqh.json","creator_id":"iam-ServiceId-f49c5558-c247-4983-a04f-7d3c7a3d55da","create_time":1703697842575,"size":3827,"is_remote":false,"is_managed":false,"is_referenced":true,"is_object_key_read_only":false,"is_user_provided_path_key":true,"transfer_complete":true,"is_partitioned":false,"complete_time_ticks":1703697842575,"user_data":{},"test_doc":0,"handle":{"bucket":"gettingstartedwithwatsonxgovernan-donotdelete-pr-9ybtncq4vbohcb","location":"us-south","type":"bluemix_cos","key":"wx_prompt/Insuranceclaimkeyinformationextraction__da__t28nebiwqh.json","upload_id":"done","max_part_num":1},"usage":{"access_count":0,"last_accessor_id":"iam-ServiceId-f49c5558-c247-4983-a04f-7d3c7a3d55da","last_access_time":1703697842575}}]}
